</p>

<p id="reason">

People who wants to calm their minds and feel the inner peace <strong> <em>must</em></strong> visit this place.

</p>

<p class="fact">

Recently a new temple of<strong> Shree Ram</strong> is built after a long debate in <em>Indian Supreme Court</em> regarding the proof that<strong> Shree Ram</strong> was born in Ayodhya.

</p>

<p class="fact">

Almost after <strong> 500 </strong> years this decision was taken. It is belived that when mughal ruled in India they destroyed the Indian temples and built their mosques. Afterwards the hindus fought against this and managed to present proof that <strong>Shree Ram </strong> was indeed born in <strong>Ayodhya</strong>.
